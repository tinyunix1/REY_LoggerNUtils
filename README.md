## Examples

### Boost Logger Integration

**REY_LoggerNUtils** seamlessly integrates with Boost Logger for additional logging functionalities. To use Boost Logger in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install Boost Library from [Boost Official Website](https://www.boost.org).
2. Update your CMAKE file to include Boost:
   ```cmake
   find_package(Boost REQUIRED log)
   include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIR})
   target_link_libraries(your_target ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
   ```

3. Use Boost Logger in your code:
   ```cpp
    #include <boost/log/trivial.hpp>

    BOOST_LOG_TRIVIAL(info) << "Boost Logger Integration Example";
   ```
